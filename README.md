lightmashine
============

Use Arduino as a RC light controller

## TODO / known issues
- Determine a good way to enter calibration mode (e.g. 5sec reverse). Needed later to reacalibrate while running lightmashine.
- Check interrupt vectors of other processors to support them too. By now only Atmega328 is working and tested.
- Documentation & installations guide ( maybe gh-pages ?)
